# PageRank Implementation in Python

## Description
This project provides a Python implementation of Google's PageRank algorithm, a foundational technique in web search ranking. The PageRank algorithm quantifies the importance of web pages based on the link structure of the web. This implementation includes both a traditional dense matrix approach and a variant using sparse matrices, catering to different scales of web graphs.

## Mathematical Background
PageRank works on the principle that important pages are likely to receive more links from other pages. Mathematically, PageRank is computed using the following formula:

PR(A) = (1 - d) + d * (PR(T1)/C(T1) + PR(T2)/C(T2) + ... + PR(Tn)/C(Tn))

Where:
- PR(A) is the PageRank of page A.
- T1, T2, ..., Tn are pages that link to page A.
- C(T) is the count of outbound links on page T.
- d is the damping factor, typically set to 0.85.

The implementation uses matrix operations to compute PageRank scores iteratively until convergence.

## Installation
Install Python and the following libraries to run the project:
- NumPy for numerical operations.
- Matplotlib for visualization.
- SciPy for handling sparse matrices.

## Usage
To use this implementation:
1. Define the adjacency matrix representing web page links.
2. Use the `PageRank` or `PageRankSparse` function to calculate the PageRank scores.
3. Use Matplotlib to visualize the PageRank scores and the adjacency matrix.

Example:
```python
import numpy as np
# Define your adjacency matrix G
# Call the PageRank function
alpha = 0.9
p, it = PageRank(G, alpha)
# Output the PageRank scores and iterations
print("PageRank Scores:", p)
print("Iterations:", it)

## Features

- Dense Matrix PageRank: Standard implementation suitable for small to medium-sized networks.
- Sparse Matrix PageRank: Efficient implementation for large-scale networks using sparse matrix techniques.
- Visualization Tools: Functions to visualize the PageRank scores and the structure of the web graph.

## FAQ

`Q: What is the damping factor in PageRank?`
A: The damping factor, typically set around 0.85, represents the probability that a user will continue clicking on links, as opposed to starting a new search.

`Q: How is the PageRank algorithm adjusted for large networks?`
A: For large networks, we use a sparse matrix representation to efficiently compute PageRank without storing the entire adjacency matrix in memory.
