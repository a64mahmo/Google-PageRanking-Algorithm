# Google-PageRanking-Algorithm
 This project provides a Python implementation of Google's PageRank algorithm, a foundational technique in web search ranking. The PageRank algorithm quantifies the importance of web pages based on the link structure of the web. This implementation includes both a traditional dense matrix approach and a variant using sparse matrices, catering to different scales of web graphs.
